WP.org Handbook Callout blocks adapted from the WP.org Handbook plugin.

## Description

The make.wordpress.org blog has wonderful callout blocks but they seem to be baked in as part of the WP.org Handbook plugin.

I was able to strip out the relevant parts of the Handbook plugin retaining only the callout blocks.

Special thanks to [@Ipstenu](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ipstenu/) for her terrific sleuthing skills.
